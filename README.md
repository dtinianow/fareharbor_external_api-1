# FareharborExternalApi


# Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fareharbor_external_api'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fareharbor_external_api

# Setup

## Requesting Access

To get started with the FareHarbor External API Gem, you will need to request access keys from FareHarbor. Please contact <support@fareharbor.com> to request access to the FareHarbor External API.

## Setting Up Your Access Keys

Once you have your access keys, you will need to set them as environment variables to work with the gem.  Below are two options for setting your environment variables.

## For Use in Production

We recommend using the Figaro gem to set your environment variables.  Follow the directions to set your keys [here.](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro#example)

In your application.yml file, set your keys like this:

    FAREHARBOR_API_APP_KEY=<your_api_app_key>
    FAREHARBOR_API_USER_KEY=<your_api_user_key>

Your key names must match the above key names exactly.  Once you are done, make sure you add application.yml to your .gitignore file to keep your keys hidden!

## For Local Use

You can either set your keys using the Figaro gem (instructions above) or inside your bash profile.  To set your keys inside your bash profile, open your bash profile and add the following lines:

```
export FAREHARBOR_API_APP_KEY=<your_api_app_key>
export FAREHARBOR_API_USER_KEY=<your_api_user_key>
```

To save your changes, enter the following in your command line:

    source ~/.bash_profile


# Usage

The FareHarbor External API Gem is a wrapper for the FareHarbor External API.  Each endpoint of the API returns data for companies associated with an affiliate or that the API-user has permission to access.

All endpoints are rooted at `https://fareharbor.com/api/external/v1/`.  

To see the full JSON output that each endpoint returns, please visit our [endpoint documentation.](https://github.com/FareHarbor/fareharbor-docs/blob/master/external-api/endpoints.md)

## Primary Usage and Finding a Company

To access a single affiliate company, you can use the find method. This will return a single company object.  The find method accepts the company 'shortname' as an argument passed in as a string. For ease of use, it is recommended that you save the result to a variable.

`company = FH::Companies.find('<company shortname>')`

You can now call methods on that company object to retrieve data about the company.  Here is a sample method being called on the company object after is has been saved as variable:

`company.items`

If you know the company shortname and name, you can also manually create an instance of a company.  Please note that if you choose to instantiate a company this way, you will need to pass in your data as a hash with keys of 'shortname' and 'name' and their respective values as strings:

`company = FH::Company.new({shortname: '<company shortname>', name: '<company name>'})`

A Company has the following attributes which can be accessed by calling them as methods:

    company = FH::Companies.find('<company shortname>')

    company.shortname
    company.name

Please see the 'Endpoints and Methods' sections below for a full list of endpoints and their corresponding methods to retrieve data.

# Endpoints and Methods

## Troubleshooting

Some methods refer to `Companies` while others refer to `Company`.  Please double-check the documentation above to ensure your syntax is correct.

Many methods take a hash as an argument.  Check the documentation above to make sure you are inputting your arguments correctly, and have included all the necessary arguments and formatted them correctly.

If you are having difficult setting your environment variables, make sure they are properly working by first testing them out in Postman.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
